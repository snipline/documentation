The core features of Snipline are:

* Store, create and retrieve your own personal list of snippets
* Variables for copying commands with unique parameter values on the fly.
* Keyboard navigation for power-users with Vim (and non-Vim) in mind.
* Available on any device with an internet connection

Although everything can be done with a mouse, the keybinds are a key focus. Vim users will feel at home using `/` to enter search and `:` to enter command mode.

Most keybinds work from mnemonics. You can also use for `s` for search, `e` to edit and `n` for a new snippet. All of the keybinds can be found within the help menu (or by pressing `?` / `h` )

There are many other features in Snipline, including the ability to pin your favourites (`:p<number>`) and adding extra documentation for understanding complex commands.
