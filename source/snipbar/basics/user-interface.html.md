Snipbar's menu window contains three main interface elements: the search, the preferences button, and the snippet table.

Searching automatically filters the snippets

You can switch to the snippet table by pressing `Tab`. From here, you can use `j`/`k` or `up`/`down` to move between snippets.

You can copy a snippet by double-clicking or pressing `Enter`.

If the snippet has a dynamic parameter you can update the text for each parameter and press `Enter` to continue.
