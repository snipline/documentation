Make sure you read the `User Interface` section before continuing.

Aside from using `j`/`k` and `up`/`down` to move between snippets you can type the `id` number to skip straight to a snippet.

<video  autoplay="" loop="" muted playsinline>
  <source src="/videos/select-snippet.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  <!-- <source src="myVideo.webm" type="video/webm"> -->
  <p>Your browser doesn't support HTML5 video. Here is
     a <a href="/videos/select-snippet.mp4">link to the video</a> instead.</p>
</video>

The following keybinds are available when in the snippet table

* `r` - Reload snippets
* `/` - Switch back to the search bar
* `j` - Select next snippet
* `k` - Select previous snippet

## Pin, edit and delete snippets

Pin snippets by swiping right over the snippet. Edit/Delete snippets by swiping left. Note that editing a snippet will take you to the web app.
