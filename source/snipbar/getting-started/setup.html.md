<video  autoplay="" loop="" muted playsinline>
  <source src="/videos/snipbar-keybind.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  <!-- <source src="myVideo.webm" type="video/webm"> -->
  <p>Your browser doesn't support HTML5 video. Here is
     a <a href="/videos/snipbar-keybind.mp4">link to the video</a> instead.</p>
</video>

The suggested keybind is `⌘⌥k` but any keybind that's not already in use with your system should work.

Once this is setup using the keybind should toggle showing the menu-bar app!
